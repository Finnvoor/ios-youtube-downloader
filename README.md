> A pythonista script for downloading youtube videos in any available format.

This script can be run from the share sheet of a YouTube video and will download the video in the selected format.  It will then present a share sheet to send the video to wherever you want.  Due to ffmpeg being unable to run in pythonista, only certain formats are available and audio and video tracks cannot be split and joined again.
